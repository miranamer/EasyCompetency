<h2>How It Works:</h2>
This extension takes the company and role you're applying for and answers the given question with respect to your prior experiences. This is done with the use of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Model.

<h2>Future Ideas:</h2>
<ul>
  
  <li>Allow users to enter their own API Key so that I can publish the extension to the chrome store</li>
  <li>Automatically infer the role and company from the URL</li>
  <li>Automatically scrape the website, find the questions and fill the answers without the user having to do anything</li>
  <li>Fine tune the GPT model to generate answers adapted to the company and role to produce more precise and accurate responses</li>
  
</ul>


<h2>Note:</h2>
This is NOT intended to be a perfect solution and you will most likely need to edit and alter the answers. This provides you a nice template and provides structure to the answers in order to give you an idea of what an answer could look like. Good Luck!
